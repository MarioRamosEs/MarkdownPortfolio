Just Order is a platform for the restaurant sector that allows the customer of a restaurant / bar to carry out the following actions with their SmartPhone

- Identify the table in the establishment
- Consult the menu, make orders (joint or individual)
- Make payments (total or partial)
- Rate the articles
- Much more.

All this with the help of a dynamically generated QR on each table.
