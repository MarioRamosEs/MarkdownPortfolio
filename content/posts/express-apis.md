In the process of learning the Node backend technology (being used to NetCore), I have built two REST API templates with Express.js

- Express + Mongoose (Mongo DB)

    I consider it the perfect stack for a simple project that needs a fast prototyping or a lot of flexibility. DB hosted in MongoDB Atlas.

- Express + TypeScript + TypeORM (MS SQL Server in Azure)

    A much more professional and scalable stack (in my opinion), since both the project itself and the ORM are TypeScript based. DB hosted in Azure.

As a result of this, I can say that I really liked the way of developing a backend API with Node.js and would certainly love to implement all of this in some future project. 

I think Express is at the same level as Net Core, since it compensates its disadvantages with a great community and support.
