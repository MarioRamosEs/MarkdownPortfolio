description: "Can Colapi GDX started as an Escape Room-style game but ended up being almost a LibGDX-based game engine of its own"
---

The game consists of a character that has to leave a mansion, a task that will not be easy since to do this, you will have to get keys, use teleports, avoid enemies and even wield a weapon to be able to get out alive depending on which areas.

The different maps are fully made, both visually and logically, with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org). You could totally change the levels and their mechanics just by replacing the tiled file, and the game engine will know how to adapt.

Project carried out together with [Alex Paredes](https://alexparedes.ovh)
