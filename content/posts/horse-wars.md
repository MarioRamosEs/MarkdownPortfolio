Online multiplayer game in real time made in Unity to test the capabilities of the engine in this area.

The player controls a horse of dubious visual quality, he will have to face other horses controlled by other players in a minimalist battlefield. The horse can shoot copies of its own head using dark alchemy. The last one to survive wins.
